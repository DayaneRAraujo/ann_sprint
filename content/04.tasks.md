# Tasks

At the hackathon we worked on the following tasks:

- Deploy a pilot survey of the researchers’ views on annotating of scientific texts
- Develop code for selecting candidate concepts for annotations (using the NLP package [scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/)) 
Review works related to annotation of texts and how they relate to the project. 
- Analyse the incentive structure and how to engage researchers in the annotation of scientific texts
- Manually annotate a sample of biomedical publications to Wikidata IDs and compare them to currently annotated pieces of text on Europe PMC
- Extract patterns related to the availability of annotated concepts in Wikidata.
- Design a logo and a name for the project
- Design an user interface and prepare a mockup “front-end”.
