# Software Frontend

A mockup of the frontend is available in Figure @fig:front  and the rules used for the user interface design are shown in Figure @fig:miro. The main idea is to make annotations made with ANN fun for annotators. Users will be able to search for a publication by PMID or title. ANN boxes will be filled in with title and abstract. Annotations  will work in a task manner where annotators will be asked to annotate a type of entity or sentence and be rewarded with ANN badge points.

When selecting a text for annotation, a window will popup and users will be able to select terms from Wikidata. The annotations will be saved in a format that is compatible with Europe PMC annotations submission system, which would add Wikidata annotations to the Europe PMC SciLite annotations features. Users would be able to login with an ORCID account and ANN would allow them to claim their annotations work to their ORCID account.
