# Manual annotations: case report

We manually annotated a sample of biomedical publications (some of which from eLife) to extract information from their abstracts as a prototype for the platform. These annotations were made mostly by people from a research-lab background, which were presented to Wikidata during this project. In that sense, they mimic what a researcher could annotate when using the ANN platform. 

The annotations and notes are available in the attached table: [Manual Annotations Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jmqW9GV04rxFwPiyidGOLN0NUzN-OWfzCkqB7RdwJbY/edit#gid=543386109). 

The following observations were made:


Annotation of PMID 19268344 [@pubmed:19268344]

“Ankyrin G” was not found on  Wikidata, but only "ankyrin". The [ankirin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q414971) item on Wikidata refers to a [protein family](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84467700), and not to the  protein itself. Later, we noticed that “Ankyrin G” was actually present on Wikidata ([here](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q21981188) or [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21131080)), but at the moment the exact term “Ankyrin G” was not listed as one alias. 

- A1 - Concepts might be present on Wikidata, but not with the exact wording they appear in scientific texts.

- A2 - The abstract of the text does not mention if the study is dealing with humans or mouse cells! Digging into the text, it mentions that "Dissociated hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic E18 rats.” The actual annotation would be [this](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28558025), but this was impossible to tell given the abstract! Annotation would solve this, and the authors would be the best to disambiguate. 

Given A3, There are some things that should always be annotated, such as the species. Which kind of things should be always annotated? How should they be required? Things such as the species of the organisms used in the study, and the techniques used to assess the question. Maybe if journals require a semantic abstract, a structured abstract with semantically enriched knowledge, some of this problems would be bypassed. 

The concept of “[hippocampal neurons](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q98842773)” was not identified separately on Wikidata, just the concepts for “[hippocampus](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48360)” and “[neuron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43054)”. Notably, even these two concepts are represented in an species-independent way. The ideal annotations would be precise for the taxon of interest. 

- A3 - Compound concepts might be split on Wikidata on its building parts. However, as per the view of the annotator, “hippocampal neuron” can be understood as an individual concept. This illustrates an  open challenge of annotation: do we annotate the parts, or do we annotate the complete concept? 


AIS, the acronym for “Axon Initial Segment” did not have a string-match on Wikidata. Notably, the concept is [present on Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q14862704) , but not the wording of the acronym, making this an instance of the problem A1 (lack of exact name). 

- A4 - The AIS acronym is present on Wikidata but for many different things (like the Australian Institute of Sport and in situ pulmonary adenocarcinoma).  Acronyms are tricky, and might need disambiguation before matching to the database. Some NLP programs like spacy have acronym disambiguation modules. 
Adding a concept to Wikidata in the perspective of a new user

# Adding a concept to Wikidata in the perspective of a new user

The concept of  “[hippocampal neurons](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q98842773)”   was created on Wikidata by a new editor. However, the creation of an item in an ontology is a challenging task. The terms used are not common for the biological research workflow. These are the perceptions of one of the team members, when creating an Wikidata item for the first time: 

_
- LABEL: main annotation for the concept. This is what would be used from SpaCY,
- DESCRIPTION: what the annotation refers to. As simple as possible. Simple words, it can reference other concepts.
- ALSO KNOWN AS/ alias : other concepts that mean the same thing (I wonder whether this could be “counted” as one, if referencing throughout an abstract). For example, when writing an abstract you use “different words” for the same thing to avoid repetition, would this be understood as one same concept if they are linked ?
(in multiple languages): All this can be done in multiple languages: 
- When adding statements:
    - you can specify if the concept is a subcategory of a different concept: SUBCLASS OF
    - you can specify if the concept is an example of a different concept:  INSTANCE OF 
    - You can also specify if the concept is PART OF: I take this to be as part of a bigger system, not necessarily immediate subclass. But this can be tricky to distinguish I think.
    - You can add an IMAGE to better describe it."_

This is the first report (as of our knowledge) of a biology researcher perspective when faced with the task of adding a new item to Wikidata. 

Given the complexity of ontological modelling, the report shows that the task is feasible. Adding a concept without training in semantic technology makes Wikidata a powerful tool, as the barrier of contribution is much lower than the one for current ontologies. The entries can be, then, adjusted later by the community, if necessary. 

Annotation of PMID 31254741 [@pubmed:31254741]

This article is related to drosophila research. Drosophila genes have frequently funny names, which might be mistaken for other entities. For the gene [frizzled](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29715259), the system worked nicely. We could find the Wikidata entry by typing "frizzled" but the official name is "fz".  The [protein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29812172) is also present, and the researchers would have to choose if they are talking about the gene or its product. 

The Van Gogh protein, on the other hand,  does not show up on Wikidata, just the [dutch post-impressionist painter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5582). For this case, the protein is not on Wikidata, but the [protein-coding gene](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29723017) is, but it gets “buried” amidst the references to the painter.  
 

- B1 - Many entities may have the same name, even when dealing with full words (and not acronyms). This ambiguity cannot be solved by looking at the word, and it might be solvable (at least partially) by looking at the context. 

- B2 - A biologically similar entity might be present, but in a slightly different way (for example, gene entry when talking about a protein). This is a more general case of problem A2, of disambiguation of gene names for different species. 

Annotation of PMID 31909712 [@pubmed:31909712]

For this article, PCP (planar cell polarity) was not found on Wikidata, just other references for the same acronym (instance of case A4). In this case, even searching for the full concept does not lead to a hit. 

- C1- The concept of interest may be completely missing. 

Of note, many scientific articles catalogued on Wikidata mention “planar cell polarity” in their titles, which might be confusing for annotation. This is a good indication that it would be useful to create the concept on Wikidata, at the very least to link to the article items via the [main subject property](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q70782961).

- C2 - The concept itself is not present, but there are scientific articles with the concept in the title. 

For [N-cadherin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21981240), the label on wikidata was “cadherin 2”, but “N-cadherin was listed as an alias. This is not a problem, but it seems to be a possible source of confusion, so it is worth mentioning it. 

- C3 - The main label on Wikidata is not the one used on the article, but the name used by the article is present as an alias. 

## Conclusion of manual annotations

The case study of manual annotations is useful to find patterns of problems in database matching. Notably, we had time only to analyse 3 of the many manual annotations made during the eLifeSprint 2020. In that way, the spreadsheet of manual annotations represent a rich resource for further exploration of the details related to annotation of biological concepts to Wikidata.
