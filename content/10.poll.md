# What are the views from the research community?

We created a survey to get the views from the research community towards the possible implementation of an annotation system. All statements refer to the respondents of the survey:

- The majority of respondents are researchers 
- PubMed and Google Scholar are the most used tools for searching scientific articles
- Most of the respondents do not know about Wikidata or they are unsure of what it is 
- Annotation is still a not so familiar concept in the community.
- The majority of respondents think that an annotation system would boost the connection between scientific articles (fig. @fig:poll1)
- Getting a better understanding and communication of scientific knowledge is perceived as an important benefit from an annotation system (fig. @fig:poll2)
- The majority of respondents would annotate their articles if this practice was encouraged by funders and/or journals (fig. @fig:poll3)
- Most of the participants would encourage, or at least mentioning, the annotation of articles to authors if they were an editor from a journal
