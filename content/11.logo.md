# Preparing a logo and a name 

During the 2020 eLife Sprint, several names for the project were brainstormed and “ANN” (short for annotate) was chosen after a pool made public to all participants of the event. 

Some logo options were prepared by two contributors and chosen after a team decision. All logos tried to bring a text highlight to convey the idea of hyperlink/annotation (Figure @fig:logodraft). The chosen logo (Figure @fig:logo) was then adapted in terms of size and colors, adopting a faded red, blue, and green color scheme - colors often used in the logos of both Wikidata and eLife. The other logo options were not completely discarded, and may contribute to the project visual identity in the future.
