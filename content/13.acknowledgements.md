# Acknowledgements

This world would not have been possible without the effort of the eLife Innovation team and the organizers of the eLife Innovation Sprint 2020, specially Emmy Tsang. All the participants of the eLife Sprint contributed to this as a community. We would like to thank Giulliano Maciocci, Micah Vandegrift and Dasapta Irawan for the discussion and insights. We would also like to thank Jo√£o Vitor Cavalcante, which contributed with code to the repository, solving issues raised at the Sprint.
