    "abstract": "Distinct molecules are segregated into somatodendritic and axonal compartments of polarized neurons, but mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of such segregation remain largely unclear. In cultured hippocampal neurons, we observed an ankyrin G- and F-actin-dependent structure that emerged in the cytoplasm of the axon initial segment (AIS) within 2 days after axon/dendrite differentiation, imposing a selective filter for diffusion of macromolecules and transport of vesicular carriers into the axon. Axonal entry was allowed for KIF5-driven carriers of synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2, but not for KIF17-driven carriers of dendrite-targeting NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. Comparisons of transport rates between chimeric forms of KIF17 and KIF5B, with the motor and cargo-binding domains switched, and between KIF5 loaded with VAMP2 versus GluR2 suggest that axonal entry of vesicular carriers depends on the transport efficacy of KIF-cargo complexes. This selective AIS filtering may contribute to preferential trafficking and segregation of cellular components in polarized neurons.",

    "abstract": "In developing tissues, sheets of cells become planar polarized, enabling coordination of cell behaviors. It has been suggested that \"signaling\" of polarity information between cells may occur either bidirectionally or monodirectionally between the molecules Frizzled (Fz) and Van Gogh (Vang). Using computational modeling we find that both bidirectional and monodirectional signaling models reproduce known non-autonomous phenotypes derived from patches of mutant tissue of key molecules but predict different phenotypes from double mutant tissue, which have previously given conflicting experimental results. Furthermore, we re-examine experimental phenotypes in the Drosophila wing, concluding that signaling is most likely bidirectional. Our modeling suggests that bidirectional signaling can be mediated either indirectly via bidirectional feedbacks between asymmetric intercellular protein complexes or directly via different affinities for protein binding in intercellular complexes, suggesting future avenues for investigation. Our findings offer insight into mechanisms of juxtacrine cell signaling and how tissue-scale properties emerge from individual cell behaviors.",

Whether planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins, which regulate cytoskeleton dynamics and appear necessary for some axon guidance, also mediate interactions with membrane adhesion is still unclear.
